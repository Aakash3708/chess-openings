Contributing
============

Improvements, additions and fixes are welcome. If you have concrete
suggestions, please be bold and submit the proposed changes directly as pull
requests!

Do not manually edit the generated files in `dist/`. You can run `make` to
update them, or let the maintainer do this.

The changes will be live on lichess.org after the next update of
[scalachess](https://github.com/lichess-org/scalachess) and the
[opening explorer](https://github.com/lichess-org/lila-openingexplorer). There
is no fixed schedule for these updates.
